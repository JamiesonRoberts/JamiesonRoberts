### Hi! 👋🏻 I'm Jamieson Roberts (he/him)!

I'm an experienced developer from Canada. In my day job, I am currently working in the e-commerce and website development space; and in my spare time, I'm constantly trying to create and try new things to learn, grow, and help those around me.

Reach out any time! I'm happy to collaborate on projects and help out with things as well!

Cheers!
